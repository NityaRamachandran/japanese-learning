    <h1>Japanese Letters</h1>
    <h4>There are totally 3 types of scripts used to read and write the japanese language</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Hiragana 平仮名</li>
        <li>katakana 片仮名</li>
        <li>Kanji 漢字</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Hiragana and Katakana are letters, whereas, the Kanji are characters each having their meaning as words</p>
    <p>The term kanji in Japanese literally means "Han characters". It is written in Japanese by using the same characters as in traditional Chinese, and both refer to the character writing system known in Chinese as hanzi </p>
    <p id="l">There is no such pronounciation as "L" in japanese. The "R" sound is used for both.</p>

    <p>
        The Hiragana is used as basic letters and the Katakana is used to denote foreign words like coffee (コーヒー)
